          "summary": "With over 20 years of global experience, I’ve had the privilege of wearing many hats—investor, mentor, founder, partner, CEO, and advisor—across a wide range of industries. My expertise spans health and beauty, FMCG, hospitality, f&amp;b, fashion, fitness, entertainment, sports, Web3, industrial products, and consulting. This diverse background has given me a unique ability to navigate complex markets and identify opportunities that drive value. For the past 14 years, I’ve been based in Saudi Arabia, where I’ve gained deep insights into the local market, culture, and business environment. My work aligns with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, collaborating with government bodies and private entities to drive innovation, growth, and economic diversification. However, my reach extends beyond the Middle East, with active business interests in Europe and North America, allowing me to bridge international best practices with local market dynamics. At the core of my professional journey is a belief in the power of relationships. I view every connection as a cornerstone of success. My global network of mentors, partners, and collaborators has been instrumental in my career, and I’m passionate about helping others succeed. If I don’t have the solution, I make it my mission to leverage my network to find someone who does. It’s this commitment to fostering meaningful connections that fuels my work as a true global connector. Throughout my career, I’ve led ventures at all stages—from ideation to scale and exit. Whether curating innovative F&amp;B concepts, transforming hospitality assets, or pioneering wellness and sports initiatives, my leadership is driven by a passion for creating impactful, sustainable businesses. I thrive on challenges that require innovative thinking and bold action, and I’m deeply committed to continuous learning, approaching every opportunity with humility and an open mind. Beyond business, I’m dedicated to giving back. Whether supporting communities, mentoring the next generation of leaders, or driving social initiatives, I aim to make a positive impact on the people and communities around me. Let’s connect, collaborate, and create something extraordinary together.",

          "summary": "Anil Chhikara is a spirited serial entrepreneur, emerging OTT actor, and a true testament to the power of following one's passion. Anil's journey has been a rich tapestry of diverse experiences, from founding EdTech startups to mentoring and consulting on a $100M+ startup portfolio, and now returning to entrepreneurship and guiding early-stage startups to success. Currently, Anil is fully immersed in two exciting new ventures: 1. Collectible Card Project: He is working on a personal passion project that focuses on collectible cards celebrating Indian history, culture, and the four major religions that originated in India—Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. This venture blends art, education, and storytelling into a unique product offering. 2. Startup EdTech Project (Stealth Mode): Anil is also spearheading a new EdTech initiative aimed at supporting both entrepreneurs and early-stage investors within India’s startup ecosystem. Still in stealth mode, this project will provide essential tools, resources, and education to help startups & investors thrive in today’s competitive market. In his previous role at Marwari Catalysts (MCats), Anil managed the early stage startup acceleration programs and global expansion. Before MCats, Anil founded Blue Bolt Electric, which provided sustainable mobility solutions via community group buying options. The company was later acquired in a strategic buyout. He also founded Bluebolt Startup Factory and the Startup India Foundation, both of which focused on strengthening the early-stage startup ecosystem in India. Anil’s earlier venture, 24x7 Learning, was one of India's pioneering EdTech startups, positioning itself as a leading e-learning company. Before embarking on his entrepreneurial journey, Anil held leadership roles at major corporations such as Wipro, HCL, Patni, PTC USA, and Cimatron Israel. Known for his candid insights and visionary approach, Anil is a sought-after startup mentor, twice TEDx speaker, and has served as a judge for high-profile pitching events and reality shows like \"Haywards 5000 Haunslay ki Udaan\" and \"The Vault Show\". His forthright style has earned him the nickname 'Katappa of Startups' within the startup community. Anil holds an engineering degree from NIT Kurukshetra, has studied Art & Art Markets at Sotheby’s Institute of Art, London, and is a trained sculptor from the New York Academy of Fine Arts. In addition to his entrepreneurial endeavors, he is an emerging OTT actor, having starred in two web series, showcasing his diverse interests and talents.",

We possessed firsthand entrepreneurial experience and understood the practical nuances of startup building and scaling.

I help companies of all sizes focus in on their customers and their needs to craft effective sales and marketing strategies built on highly value added products and a clear communications strategy I’ve worked with established businesses looking to grow incrementally, startups looking to scale exponentially and pre-seed companies just looking to take their first steps and have extensive experience and knowledge of current marketing techniques regardless of budget. I’ve led sales and marketing divisions in domestic B2C services businesses, global industrial and B2G markets and have launched online businesses here and abroad across service, manufacturing and technology products. I’ve worked in multinationals like Carl Zeiss, national players such as eir and a number of small companies and startups. I firmly believe that each business is different, and understanding what it’s owners, managers and stakeholders are looking to achieve is key to developing a strong, implementable strategy which reinforces and is fed by the underlying culture of the company. My particular passions are strategic alignment across all aspects of the marketing mix to ensure consistent messaging and a strong customer experience coupled with lightweight but effective sales operations which support the sales team without swamping it in admin, whilst still ensuring sufficient performance insight to allow management to do its job.",

In undergrad at Washington University in St. Louis, I double majored in Systems Engineering and Economics - cultivating a problem solving mindset by drilling advanced quantitative exercises. By learning how to structure information and apply frameworks, I’ve grown confident in my ability to breakdown, organize, and work through highly complex assignments. After graduating I joined the Venture for America fellowship, and worked as an analyst at a Venture Capital fund. There, I learned the ins and outs of venture investing, and have been leveraging that experience to work with early stage startups since - consulting on business models, value prop. alignment, and storyboarding to improve their access to capital and position them for growth. To round out my startup skill set, I’m now getting a Masters in Technology Entrepreneurship at Notre Dame, where I’m focused on developing unstructured problem solving skills and succeeding in ambiguity.",

While the organization had historically been very successful in achieving its mission, their participation rates were starting to decline. Through Washington University’s Taylor Community Consulting Program, I got the opportunity to consult for FOCUS Marines Foundation as the project lead of our team. My team consisted of myself and five Olin MBA students and data analytics masters students. Using my critical thinking and leadership skills, I lead all team and client meetings - ultimately helping our team identify organizational branding as a crucial area of improvement. Being a non-profit, FMF was extremely cost conscious. They emphasized maintaining a low-cost structure as a central component to FMF’s mission and culture. To address this problem, my team and I researched many cost-effective branding strategies and implemented cost-efficient solutions to address FMF’s branding issues: 1. Google Analytics for non-profits (free) 2. Designed Brand New Website (free for non-profits using wix.com) 3. Coordinated Facebook Ads to Target Geographically Centralized Military Populations (cost efficient marketing) Together, our re-branding recommendations helped the client increase donor contributions, program participation, and diversify the organization’s volunteer base. FOCUS Marines Foundation was so impressed with our recommendations, they even asked myself and one other team member to continue consulting the following semester. Due to study abroad, I had to decline the opportunity, but FOCUS Marines Foundation remains one of my favorite project management experiences to date. Show less",

Through the Taylor Community Consulting Program, I was tasked with leading a team of myself, one MBA student, and four data analytics masters students in providing a benchmarking analysis of CCSTL communication strategies (with respect to other national organizations) and suggesting recommendations for improvement. As project manager, I took advantage of the Taylor program's flexible managerial guidelines and broke the assignment into 3 phases, (1) data collection/synthesis (2) analysis/market research (3) benchmarking report/recommendations, and established team roles to take ownership over different parts of our process. In the span of only 8 weeks, I navigated the team through a host of critical and time-consuming tasks such as: designing a comprehensive communications survey (focused on external and internal communication), collecting qualitative data from 25 catholic charities, creating a scoring system to convert qualitative comm data to quantitative comm data, building a benchmarking report breaking down various catholic charity communication strategies and their effectiveness, and speaking with marketing professors and brand strategists to conduct market research. Our final recommendations helped CCSTL identify areas of improvement and find value by suggesting implementation other industry practices. In providing these recommendations, my team and I were able to establish an actionable communication framework that was tailored to the specific needs of our client - ultimately empowering CCSTL to aid even more people in St. Louis.

It works by matching college students with job openings at partnered companies similar to job posting websites like WayUp and Indeed but implementing a much more advanced matching algorithm to ensure candidates meet specific company criteria before any recruiter introductions are made. During the Fall of 2017, RippleMatch was aggressively expanding its student base from only Ivy League resumes to include the top 62 universities in the country. It was my job to facilitate RippleMatch's growth at Washington University. My primary instruction were to leverage social connections to increase RippleMatch signups, but I wanted to do more. After signing up 30 of my closest friends, I brainstormed additional strategies to increase signups. Instead of leveraging personal relationships, I thought about identifying the target student. Who were they? How could I identify them? What is the best way to market RippleMatch to them? After considering these questions, I suggested to management we partner with the WashU Career Center. Not only does the career center see more students looking for jobs than my immediate friend circle, but the career center also has much more credibility when it comes to recommending new job search engines. My manager was skeptical and told me career center partnerships hadn't worked at other universities, so I should stick to social networking. But I believed my idea had potential and sought to orchestrate a partnership on my own time. After persisting with multiple forms of communication, my hard work paid off. I arranged a meeting with a career center official, pitched the RippleMatch platform, and captured the attention of the business school's career center. My drive to go the extra mile led to the RippleMatche’s first ever career center partnership and serves as an example of my determination and knack for creating value when given the chance to do so.

Participants research a Boeing patent currently being used in the aerospace industry and incorporate it into a new invention to solve a unrealated real world problem. Contestants present their idea to a team of actual Boeing executives for judgement. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My team's product was CyClean What it does: CyClean filters out dangerous particulate matter from smoke produced by coal-fired plants while also separating the harmful greenhouse gases out for productive use. Social Issue: The World Health Organization estimates that 4.6 million people die each year from causes directly attributable to air pollution, specifically particulate matter over the size of 10 microns in the air Business Issue: CyClean is marketed towards coal combustion factories by capturing harmful emissions - allowing factories to produce more power without infringing upon government pollution regulations. Competition: Other devices currently exist which remove harmful partiulates from coal buring plants, but with an enormous energy input. CyClean is the only device that requires no external energy source and doesn't require additional devices to filter greenhouse gases. Show less"

I would receive calls from doctors, Nurses, residents , hospitals, frontline workers for support , to the extent that one wanted me “to get tailors together and stitch them gowns as there was no quality PPE available” , another said “why can’t I help thru some technology and eradicate corona“ “I have 2 masks and have been washing and wearing them, there is no inventory of medical supplies available for PPE, masks shields, and we dont know whether to care for patients , our families or our selves.\" In the beginning I didn’t know how to help , I would just listen, try telling them that help would come. I would have sleepless nights feeling helpless. As COVID-19 unfolded in all its terror, I just couldn't wait and watch. With God’s grace, what started as a discussion on community testing of corona with a friend, today is a voluntary initiative under name of SaveOurSaviours and SaveOurDoctors (https://saveourdoctors.in) with only One Mission to Save Frontline Warriors. http://www.facebook.com/SaveOurDoctors is a testimony of our service Thank You for coming forward , believing in this cause and having faith in us 🙏 The frontline warriors- medics, sanitation workers, public health workers, police task force - they stand for us , protect us , feed us To provide armours to frontline warriors to fight Corona War donate at : https://rzp.io/l/SaveOurDoctors https://saveourdoctors.in/ #SaveOurDoctors #SaveOurSaviours #SaveHumanity #CreateHistory",
